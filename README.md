# CodeNextWebDev
My final project for Intro to Web Dev in the Google Code Next 2021 Fall Semester

Code Next is a program in which high school students get the opportunity to learn to code from real Googlers, and help them learn many different aspects of coding to help them 
find what they would be interested in. It consists of three clubs, each of which take place during a seperate semester - fall, winter, and spring. This year, the three available
clubs are Intro to Web Dev (which I did first), Breakbeat Coding (making music with code), and Creative Coding (I believe using JS to make animations). At the end of each
club, we make a final project, and a few of us from each club are selected to present ours for Demo Day (not everybody). This was my final project that I did along with my
partner, which I presented at Demo Day: a website about the 7 Wonders of the World. There's no JS in the website but that's simply because the club didn't cover JS in its
curriculum, only HTML and CSS.

        The New Seven Wonders of the World
      </h1>
      <p>
        The original seven wonders of the world were chosen thousands of years ago. They were the Great Pyramids of Giza, Hanging Gardens of Babylon,
        Statue of Zeus, Temple of Artemis, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, Colossus of Rhodes, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Only one of them is still
        standing--the Pyramids of Giza. These new seven wonders were chosen in 2000 through an online contest created by a Swiss company called the New
        7 Wonders Foundation. In this, tens of millions of people voted to decide the new wonders of the world. These new wonders of the world are down
        below, along with information about their history. We hope this helps you learn more about the new seven wonders of the world!

          The Chichen Itza is a large city built by the Mayan people in the pre-Columbian era, located in Yucatan State, Mexico.
          Not much is known about this once large and flourishing city, but it was said to have one of the most diverse populations in the Maya world.
          This may or may not have played a role in the many different architectural styles found at this site.
          Besides it's beautiful architecture the Chichen Itza is said to have over 365 steps, the total number of days in a solar year. 
          It comes to no suprise that the Chichen Itza is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world with over 2.6 million visits in 2017.

          The Great Wall of China is a 5,500 mile long wall built on the northen borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China. The great wall streches from Liaodong to Lop Lake. 
          Many parts of the wall were built around the 7th century BC and were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (the first emperor of China) around 220 - 206 BC,
          and most recently the Ming dynasty in 1368 - 1644. Though Qin Shi Huang and the Ming dynasty were not the only ones to aid in the building of the Great Wall.
          Besides from it's defensive purposes, the Great wall was also used to regulate trade, immogration, and emmogration. It was also said that the Great Wall served more as "Political Propoganda" more than it did defense.

          Chrsit the Redeemer is a large statue, standing at 98 feet tall (not including the base), that is located on the top of Mount Corcavado in Rio de Janerio.
          This colossal statue was built in 1926 and desined by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. It wasn't until 1931 that the statue was finished.
          The idea of this statue originated a little after WWI took place and many Brazilians feared a "tide of godlessness". Christ the Redeemer is also the largest Art Deco
          statue in the world with an armspan (92 feet across) almost as long as it's height. Fun Fact: Christ the Redeemer has been struck by lightning multiple times and Jesus's
          right thumb was damaged during a storm.

          Known as one of the most iconic structures in the entire world, the Taj Mahal is a large mausoleum complex in Agra, India. Constructed in 1631 by Emperor Shah Jahan, the Taj Mahal
          was built to honor Emperor Jahan's wife Mumtaz Mahal. It took around 22 years and over 20,000 workers to finally build the Taj Mahal, which features a large garden and a beatiful
          reflecting pool located at the front of the mausoleum. It was said that emperor Jahan wanted his own mausoleum to be built out of black marble(he most likely wanted to do this
          to contrast his wifes mausoleum which was made out of white marble) but, he was sadly killed by one of his sons before any work could begin.

          The Colosseum is a large amphitheater in Rome that measures to about 620 by 513 feet. Built by emperor Vespasian in the first century, the Colosseum had a holding capacity of
          about 50,000 people. Besides most of its fame coming from the large amount of gladiator fights taking place in the Colosseum, executions, battle re-enactments, dramas, and even
          animal hunts were few of the many events that the Colosseum was used for. So many animals were captured and killed in the Colosseum that some species are said to be extinct.
          Over 500,000 poeple died in the Colosseum and it was even debated that Christians were martyred in the Colosseum by being fed to lions.

          Machu Picchu is an Incan ruin located near Cuzco, Peru that was "discovered" by archealogist and U.S Politician, Hiram Bingham. Although this site has been studied for many years
          it purpose is still a mystery. Bingham claimed that the Machu Picchu was home to "Virgins of the Sun", while some believed it to be a pilgrimage site, and others a royal retreat.
          Besides the Chicen Itza, Machu Picchu is one of the very few pre-Columbian strutures still intact. Machu Picchu is filled with terraces, residential areas, plazas, and temples.
          Fun fact: In 2000 a crane that was being used for a beer ad fell and cracked the monument.
